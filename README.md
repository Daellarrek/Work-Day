# Work-Day-Scheduling.

## On this activity you can set reminders for yourself for different activities through out the day. 

## All you have to do is select a time frame in which the activitey will occur and once done typing it out hit the save button on the right side of the time block. 

## Once saved you will be able to go back to the page through out the day and see what activities you are supposed to be doing throughout the day. 

## If something is on a time block for a past time then it will appear grayed out. If it is red, that is the current time frame. And if it is green, that means those are your future tasks.
